### Create a Simple Bootstrap Navigation Bar

Good news, you don't really have to create the navbar from scratch. You just have to select the right tags and add the correct bootstrap class names.

Here are the steps I would take to 'create' or select a bootstrap nav bar.



#### **1) Google search bootstrap nav bar.**
