# Week-3 -- Day-2

## GIT

### When do we fork a repo and when do we clone a repo?

Simple!

Fork it if you want a copy and change ownership at the same time. You will have a copy of the repo along with all the commits and branches from the original author.

Clone it if you want to just 'Download' the code to your computer.

In both cases you need to take additional steps to contribute back to the original repo of the original author.

Notice how after you click on fork and it's done forking it takes to the same exact repo but with you as the owner!

## HTML CSS Better Practices

 - End all html files with the extension **.html** not .htm
 - Get in the habit of creating good README.md files!
 - Don't forget to update all references to stylesheet or javascript fileafter you have moved it to another folder!  
 - Don't forget !DOCTYPE, HTML, HEAD, TITLE, BODY when creating a new HTML document.
 - Comment each section in your HTML, CS and JavaScript file.
 - Make sure dev tools (console) is up in Chrome when checking out the html rendering of your page!
 - Use one form tag for each form. You do not need a seperate form tag for each form element.

## Git This!

You only need to memorize three commands when it comes to git

    git add .
    git commit -m "what changes have you made"
    git push origin master

Well I lied. Maybe also these three

    git status
    git remote -v
    git init
